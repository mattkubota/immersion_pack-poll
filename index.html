      <img src="visuals/visual-1.png" class="visual" id="visual-1">
      <p class="text">Students were asked on a scale of 1-11 how they felt about immigrants’ impact on cultural life, the economy, and the United States as a place to live with 1 being the most negative and 11 being the most positive. We found a overall majority support among NC Students but a clear divide does exist between Clinton and Trump voters.</p>
